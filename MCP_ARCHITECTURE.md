# MCP Orchestrator Architecture Clarification

## How It Actually Works

When you're using Claude Code:

1. **Primary Response**: You ask a question → I (Claude Sonnet 4 or Opus 4) respond directly
   - This is the normal Claude Code interaction
   - No MCP tools involved yet

2. **Enhancement via MCP Tools**: If you want additional perspectives or validation:
   - Use `multi_model_review` → Gemini 2.5 Pro and O3 analyze MY response
   - Use `comparative_analysis` → Compare different approaches using external models
   - Use `think_deeper` → Get deeper analysis from Gemini/O3

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Write a function to calculate fibonacci"
Claude (me): "Here's a fibonacci function: [provides code]"

User: "Use multi_model_review on this"
MCP Tool: 
  - Takes my response
  - Sends it to Gemini 2.5 Pro: "Review this fibonacci implementation"
  - Sends it to O3: "Analyze the architecture of this solution"
  - Returns combined insights
```

## Key Points

1. **Claude is NOT orchestrated** - I'm already here, responding to you
2. **MCP orchestrates external models** - Gemini and O3 provide additional perspectives
3. **Tools enhance, not replace** - They add value to my existing responses

## Current Implementation Issue

The current code has "Claude Direct" adapter which is redundant because:
- You're already talking to Claude (me)
- We don't need to "orchestrate" Claude when Claude is already the primary interface

## Correct Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
Claude (in Claude Code) - Primary Response
    ↓
[Optional] MCP Tools
    ↓
External Models (Gemini, O3) - Enhancement/Validation
    ↓
Combined Insights
```

## Tool Purposes

- **multi_model_review**: Get Gemini & O3's opinion on my response
- **think_deeper**: Ask Gemini/O3 to expand on a topic
- **comparative_analysis**: Have external models compare approaches
- **code_review**: Get external models to review code I provided
