# MCP Orchestrator Tools Status

## ✅ All Tools Working with External Models Only

**Important**: The orchestrator uses ONLY external models (Gemini 2.5 Pro and O3). It does NOT use Claude models since users already interact with Claude directly.

### Core Orchestration Tools

1. **orchestrate_task** ✅
   - Enhanced with file reading for codebase analysis
   - Model-specific prompts based on task type
   - Shows confidence scores and strategy used
   - Transparent cost tracking

2. **analyze_task** ✅
   - Reads files when analyzing codebases
   - Recommends optimal strategy
   - Detects languages and frameworks

3. **query_specific_model** ✅
   - Direct access to any model
   - Uses model-specific prompts
   - Supports all parameters

### Specialized Analysis Tools

4. **code_review** ✅
   - Multi-model code analysis
   - Severity ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Security, performance, and quality checks
   - Uses FileManager for reading code

5. **think_deeper** ✅
   - Extended reasoning with max thinking tokens
   - Progressive deep dive strategy
   - Challenges assumptions
   - Synthesis from multiple models

6. **multi_model_review** ✅
   - Forces parallel consultation of all models
   - Shows each model's perspective with confidence
   - Cost breakdown per model
   - Comparison of approaches

7. **comparative_analysis** ✅
   - Decision matrices for comparing options
   - Scoring across multiple criteria
   - Consensus recommendations
   - Cost-benefit analysis

### Git and Quick Tools

8. **review_changes** ✅
   - Reviews git diffs before commit
   - Validates against requirements
   - Finds incomplete implementations
   - Security-focused analysis

9. **quick_claude** ❌ DEPRECATED
   - This tool returns an error message
   - Users already have direct access to Claude
   - No need to "orchestrate" Claude

### Configuration Tools

10. **get_orchestrator_status** ✅
    - Shows usage statistics
    - Cost tracking
    - Model availability

11. **update_session_context** ✅
    - Maintains context between calls
    - Improves response quality

12. **configure_orchestrator** ✅
    - Runtime configuration updates
    - Cost limits
    - Quality modes

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. **File Reading**
All tools that analyze code now actually read files:
- `orchestrate_task` - Reads up to 50 files from codebase
- `analyze_task` - Reads files for better analysis
- `code_review` - Uses FileManager for comprehensive review

### 2. **Model-Specific Prompts**
Each external model receives prompts tailored to its strengths:
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Leverages 1M context for codebase-wide analysis
- **O3**: Architecture and system design focus

### 3. **Value-Add Features**
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows model confidence in responses
- **Cost Transparency**: Every response includes cost breakdown
- **Actionable Output**: Specific recommendations, not generic advice
- **Comparative Analysis**: See how different models approach problems

### 4. **Dynamic Context**
Models can request additional information:
```json
{
  "status": "requires_clarification",
  "question": "Need to see the test files",
  "files_needed": ["tests/test_*.py"]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Analyze a Codebase
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__orchestrate_task
description: "Analyze this codebase architecture and suggest improvements"
strategy: "max_quality_council"
```

### Compare Technologies
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__comparative_analysis
options: ["PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "DynamoDB"]
criteria: ["scalability", "cost", "developer_experience"]
context: "Building a social media platform"
```

### Quick Code Review
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__code_review
files: ["src/main.py", "src/utils/"]
review_type: "security"
severity_filter: "high"
```

### Deep Problem Solving
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__think_deeper
problem: "How to handle distributed transactions without 2PC?"
thinking_mode: "max"
```

## Verification

Run the quick test:
```bash
./quick_test.sh
```

Or test individual components:
```bash
# Test REST API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/mcp/get_orchestrator_status

# Test with example script
python examples/integration_example.py
```

## Network Access

### REST API (Port 5050)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/mcp/orchestrate_task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Analyze this code"}'
```

### WebSocket (Port 8765)
See `examples/integration_example.py` for WebSocket usage.

## Docker Deployment

All tools are included in the Docker image:
```bash
# Deploy with network bridges
./start_network_services.sh

# Or standard MCP deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The MCP server includes all tools (except deprecated quick_claude) with external model integration.
