   - Zero additional cost
   - Best for simple tasks

### Configuration Tools

10. **get_orchestrator_status** ✅
    - Shows usage statistics
    - Cost tracking
    - Model availability

11. **update_session_context** ✅
    - Maintains context between calls
    - Improves response quality

12. **configure_orchestrator** ✅
    - Runtime configuration updates
    - Cost limits
    - Quality modes

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. **File Reading**
All tools that analyze code now actually read files:
- `orchestrate_task` - Reads up to 50 files from codebase
- `analyze_task` - Reads files for better analysis
- `code_review` - Uses FileManager for comprehensive review

### 2. **Model-Specific Prompts**
Each model receives prompts tailored to its strengths:
- Gemini: Leverages 1M context for codebase-wide analysis
- O3: Architecture and system design focus
- Claude Opus: Deep reasoning and complex debugging
- Claude Sonnet: Practical implementation

### 3. **Value-Add Features**
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows model confidence in responses
- **Cost Transparency**: Every response includes cost breakdown
- **Actionable Output**: Specific recommendations, not generic advice
- **Comparative Analysis**: See how different models approach problems

### 4. **Dynamic Context**
Models can request additional information:
```json
{
  "status": "requires_clarification",
  "question": "Need to see the test files",
  "files_needed": ["tests/test_*.py"]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Analyze a Codebase
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__orchestrate_task
description: "Analyze this codebase architecture and suggest improvements"
strategy: "max_quality_council"
```

### Compare Technologies
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__comparative_analysis
options: ["PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "DynamoDB"]
criteria: ["scalability", "cost", "developer_experience"]
context: "Building a social media platform"
```

### Quick Code Review
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__code_review
files: ["src/main.py", "src/utils/"]
review_type: "security"
severity_filter: "high"
```

### Deep Problem Solving
```
/mcp__mcp-orchestrator__think_deeper
problem: "How to handle distributed transactions without 2PC?"
thinking_mode: "max"
```

## Verification

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
python test_all_mcp_tools.py
```

This tests all 12 tools to ensure they're working properly.

## Docker Deployment

All tools are included in the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t mcp-orchestrator:enhanced .
./deploy_mcp.sh
```

The enhanced MCP server includes all tools with their improvements.
