#### ⚡ `quick_claude` ⭐ NEW
- **Forces** Claude-only for maximum speed
- Supports all thinking modes (minimal to max)
- Parameters: task, code_context, thinking_mode
- Example: "Use quick_claude with minimal thinking to explain variables"

#### 🔍 `review_code`
- Professional code review with severity levels
- Orchestrates multiple models for thorough analysis
- Parameters: files, review_type, focus_areas
- Example: "Use review_code on auth.py focusing on security"

#### 🧠 `think_deeper`
- Extended reasoning for complex problems
- Uses max thinking mode by default
- Parameters: problem, current_thinking, focus_areas

- Token budgets: 128 → 2,048 → 8,192 → 16,384 → 32,768
- Automatic mode selection based on task complexity
- Cost optimization through intelligent token management

#### ✅ **Usage Summary** ⭐ NEW
Every response now ends with:
```
---
🤖 Models: claude-direct, google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview, openai/gpt-4.1 | 💰 Cost: $0.0023 | 📊 Strategy: max_quality_council
```

#### ✅ **Dynamic Context Requests** (From Beehive)
- Models can request additional files/context mid-execution
- Up to 3 iterations of clarification
- JSON format for clear communication
- Enables true collaborative problem-solving

#### ✅ **Specialized Prompts** (From Beehive)
- Role-specific prompts for each task type
- Professional personas (senior dev, code reviewer, debugger)
- Automatically applied based on task analysis
- Improves response quality and relevance

#### ✅ **Multi-Model Orchestration**
- **Progressive Deep Dive**: Claude-only for efficiency
- **Max Quality Council**: Parallel consultation of multiple models
- Automatic strategy selection based on complexity
- Manual override available

#### ✅ **Cost Management**
- Per-request cost limits
- Daily budget tracking
- Warning thresholds
- Cost included in usage summary

### 3. **Available Models**

#### Currently Active:
- ✅ **claude_direct**: Uses me (Claude) directly - no API calls
- ✅ **gemini_pro**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro via OpenRouter
- ✅ **gpt4_fallback**: GPT-4.1 via OpenRouter
- ⚠️ **o3_architect**: O3 via OpenAI (requires valid API key)

### 4. **How to Use Each Feature**

#### Force Multi-Model Review (NEW):
```
"Use multi_model_review to analyze this authentication code"
# Forces: Claude + Gemini + GPT-4 in parallel
```

#### Force Quick Claude (NEW):
```
"Use quick_claude with minimal thinking to format this code"
# Forces: Claude-only with 128 token budget
```

#### Natural Thinking Control:
```
"Use orchestrate with high thinking to solve this algorithm"
# Uses: 16,384 token budget automatically
```

#### Check What's Happening:
```
"Use orchestrator_status"
# Shows: All available models, tools, and statistics
```

### 5. **What Makes This Special**

1. **Explicit Control**: You decide when to use multiple models
2. **Transparent Usage**: Every response shows exactly what was used
3. **Cost Visibility**: See the cost of each request
4. **Flexible Strategies**: From quick Claude-only to full multi-model council
5. **Smart Defaults**: Automatic optimization when you don't specify

### 6. **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# See all available tools and models
"Use orchestrator_status"

# Force multi-model on simple task (proves it works)
"Use multi_model_review to check if x=1 is good code"

# Quick Claude with minimal thinking
"Use quick_claude with minimal thinking to explain loops"

# Let system decide (smart selection)
"Use orchestrate to review this security code: password='admin'"
```
