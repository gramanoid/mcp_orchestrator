# 🚀 MCP Orchestrator - Complete Features List

**Important**: The MCP Orchestrator uses ONLY external models (Gemini 2.5 Pro and O3). It does NOT orchestrate Claude since users are already interacting with Claude directly.

## ✅ All Integrated Features Available via MCP

### 1. **Core Orchestration Tools** 
These are the tools you can call directly from Claude Code:

#### 📊 `orchestrator_status`
- Shows available models, strategies, and usage statistics
- No parameters needed
- Example: "Use orchestrator_status"

#### 🎯 `orchestrate`
- Direct control over orchestration with any strategy
- Parameters: task, strategy, code_context, thinking_mode
- Includes usage summary in response
- Example: "Use orchestrate with max_quality_council strategy to review this code"

#### 🤖 `multi_model_review`
- Gets perspectives from multiple external models (Gemini + O3)
- Ideal when you want diverse external insights
- Parameters: task, code_context, focus_areas
- Example: "Use multi_model_review to check if this is secure: password='123'"

#### ⚡ `quick_claude` (DEPRECATED)
- This tool is deprecated and returns an error
- Users already have direct access to Claude
- No need to "orchestrate" Claude when you're already using Claude

#### 🔍 `review_code`
- Professional code review with severity levels
- Orchestrates multiple models for thorough analysis
- Parameters: files, review_type, focus_areas
- Example: "Use review_code on auth.py focusing on security"

#### 🧠 `think_deeper`
- Extended reasoning for complex problems
- Uses max thinking mode by default
- Parameters: problem, current_thinking, focus_areas
- Example: "Use think_deeper about microservices vs monolith"

#### 📝 `review_changes` ⭐ NEW
- Pre-commit validation of git changes
- Checks multiple repositories recursively
- Parameters: path, original_request, review_type
- Example: "Use review_changes to validate my pending commits"

### 2. **Enhanced Features Integrated**

#### ✅ **Thinking Modes**
- Natural language control: "use minimal/low/medium/high/max thinking"
- Token budgets: 128 → 2,048 → 8,192 → 16,384 → 32,768
- Automatic mode selection based on task complexity
- Cost optimization through intelligent token management

#### ✅ **Usage Summary**
Every response now ends with:
```
---
🤖 Models: google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview, o3 | 💰 Cost: $0.0023 | 📊 Strategy: external_enhancement
```

#### ✅ **Dynamic Context Requests** (From Beehive)
- Models can request additional files/context mid-execution
- Up to 3 iterations of clarification
- JSON format for clear communication
- Enables true collaborative problem-solving

#### ✅ **Specialized Prompts** (From Beehive)
- Role-specific prompts for each task type
- Professional personas (senior dev, code reviewer, debugger)
- Automatically applied based on task analysis
- Improves response quality and relevance

#### ✅ **Multi-Model Orchestration**
- **External Enhancement**: Single external model for efficiency
- **Max Quality Council**: Parallel consultation of multiple external models
- Automatic strategy selection based on complexity
- Manual override available

#### ✅ **Network Bridges** (NEW)
- REST API on port 5050 for HTTP integration
- WebSocket on port 8765 for real-time communication
- Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment
- Support for any programming language or platform

#### ✅ **Cost Management**
- Per-request cost limits
- Daily budget tracking
- Warning thresholds
- Cost included in usage summary

### 3. **Available Models**

#### External Models Only:
- ✅ **gemini_pro**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro via OpenRouter
- ✅ **o3_architect**: O3 via OpenAI (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)

#### NOT Available:
- ❌ **claude_direct**: Removed - users already have Claude
- ❌ **Any Claude models**: Not needed since you're using Claude directly

### 4. **How to Use Each Feature**

#### Get External Model Review:
```
"Use multi_model_review to analyze this authentication code"
# Gets: Gemini + O3 perspectives (external models only)
```

#### Direct Model Query:
```
"Use query_specific_model with gemini_pro to explain React hooks"
# Queries: Specific external model directly
```

#### Natural Thinking Control:
```
"Use orchestrate with high thinking to solve this algorithm"
# Uses: 16,384 token budget automatically
```

#### Check What's Happening:
```
"Use orchestrator_status"
# Shows: All available models, tools, and statistics
```

### 5. **What Makes This Special**

1. **External Models Only**: Exclusively uses Gemini and O3, not Claude
2. **Network Accessible**: REST API and WebSocket bridges for any app
3. **Transparent Usage**: Every response shows exactly what was used
4. **Cost Visibility**: See the cost of each request
5. **Flexible Strategies**: From single model to multi-model council
6. **Bug-Free**: All known issues fixed (ResponseSynthesizer, lifecycle)

### 6. **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# See all available tools and models
"Use orchestrator_status"

# Get external perspectives on simple task
"Use multi_model_review to check if x=1 is good code"

# Query specific external model
"Use query_specific_model with o3_architect to design a cache system"

# Let system decide (smart selection)
"Use orchestrate to review this security code: password='admin'"
```
